Next steps to apply the consolidation:

1. Backup the templates directory first:
   copy src/main/resources/templates src/main/resources/templates.backup

2. Run the cleanup script:
   node cleanup-templates.js

3. Verify routes in the controller are all defined

4. Test the application:
   mvn clean package

This will delete 286 extra/variant files and keep only the 83 recipe files.
